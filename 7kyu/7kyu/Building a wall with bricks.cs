//Scenario
//A construction master applies specific rules when creating walls. But the construction master cannot calculate the exact number of bricks to be spent on the walls.

//For this reason, you are expected to write a method that calculates the number of bricks that need to be spent for the wall whose width and height are clear.

//Rules
//Only 3 kinds of bricks can be used. Large Brick(60 cm), Medium Brick(40 cm) and Small Brick(20cm)
//The height of all bricks is 5 cm and wall height is always 5 cm and multiples.
//The Wall width is always 60 cm and multiples.
//The lowest row should be composed of only large bricks.
//After that, the first brick from the right of the next row must be the middle brick, the first brick from the left is the small brick.
//Finally, The first brick from the right of the next row must be the small brick, the first brick from the left is the medium brick.
//The first row after the series is completed again consists of large bricks and the cycle continues.
//The number of bricks used should return to the following format. "21L6M6S"
//If number of medium and small bricks is 0, then answer should be the following format. "21L"

//Example Wall

//Wall height is 45 cm and wall width is 180 cm. There are 21 large bricks.
//(Yellow bricks) There are 6 medium bricks.
//(Green bricks) There are 6 small bricks.
//(Pink bricks)

//So answer is "21L6M6S"
