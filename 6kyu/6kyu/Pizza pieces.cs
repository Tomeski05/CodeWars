//In her trip to Italy, Elizabeth Gilbert made it her duty to eat perfect pizza.
//One day she ordered one for dinner, and then some Italian friends appeared at her room.
//The problem is that there were many people who ask for a piece of pizza at that moment, and she had a knife that only cuts straight.

//Given the number of pizza cuts, find the maximum amount of pieces of pizza that you can get (not necessarily of equal size).
//If the number of cuts is negative, return -1 instead (or Nothing in Haskell).
